#  The network of bottlenose dolphins was assembled and studied by Lusseau et al. - refer to
#  Lusseau, D., Schneider, K., Boisseau, O., Haase, P., Slooten, E., and Dawson,
#  S. (2003). The bottlenose dolphin community of doubtful sound features a large
#  proportion of long-lasting associations - can geographic isolation explain this unique
#  trait? Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 54:396â€“405.
#  The particular group of dolphins exhibited exceptionally strong and long lasting connections
#  which are reflected by edges of the network. There are 62 nodes and 159 edges in total.
