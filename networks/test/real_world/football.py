#  The network was assembled by Girvan and Newman - refer to:

#  It reflects the schedule of American College football league in year 2000.
#  Nodes correspond to teams while an edge exists between two vertices if the teams they
#  represent played a game together during the season. Importantly, teams are separated
#  into conferences based on geographical proximity and games between teams in the same
#  conference are more frequent that games between those from different divisions.
#  Thus, a ground truth community partition corresponds to the conference structure of the
#  league. There are 115 nodes, 613 edges and 12 ground truth communities in the network.
